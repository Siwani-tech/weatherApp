Project Description:
The Interactive Weather App with Leaflet is a web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions and forecasts for different locations around the world. It provides an intuitive and interactive user interface that combines geographical mapping with weather data.

Key Features:

   üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map: The app prominently features an interactive map powered by Leaflet, a popular JavaScript mapping library. Users can navigate the map, zoom in/out, and click on specific locations to retrieve weather information.

    Location Search: Users can search for weather data for a specific location by entering the name of a city or a geographic coordinate (latitude and longitude). The app supports global location searches.

    Real-time Weather Data: The app fetches real-time weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) using AJAX requests. It displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons.

    Forecast Information: Users can access weather forecasts for the selected location, including daily and hourly forecasts. The app presents forecast data in an easy-to-read format, including temperature trends and precipitation probabilities.

    Location Details: Upon selecting a location on the map or from search results, the app provides detailed information about the location, such as its name, country, and geographic coordinates.

    Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Technologies Used:

    Leaflet: The mapping library used to create an interactive map interface.
    JavaScript: The core programming language for implementing app logic and handling API requests.
    Weather API: Integration with a weather data API to fetch real-time weather information.
    HTML/CSS: Structuring the user interface and applying styles for a pleasant user experience.
